### A simple example for beginners

Due to popular request, I've created a simple example for getting started with the facerec framework.

#### Getting the data right 

We aren't doing a toy example, so you'll need some image data. For sake of simplicity I have assumed, that the images (the faces, persons you want to recognize) are given in folders. So imagine I have a folder `images` (the dataset!), with the subfolders person1, person2 and so on:

```
philipp@mango:~/facerec/data/images$ tree -L 2 | head -n 20
.
|-- person1
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg
|-- person2
|   |-- 1.jpg
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- 3.jpg
|   |-- 4.jpg

[...]
```

One of the public available datasets, that is already coming in such a folder structure is the AT&T Facedatabase, available at:

* [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html)

Once unpacked it is going to look like this (on my filesystem it is unpacked to /home/philipp/facerec/data/at/, your path is different!):

```
philipp@mango:~/facerec/data/at$ tree .
.
|-- README
|-- s1
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm
|-- s2
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm
|-- s3
|   |-- 1.pgm
|   |-- 2.pgm
[...]
|   `-- 10.pgm

...

40 directories, 401 files
```

That's all that needs to be done.

#### Example: Fisherfaces

The following code listing now will learn a Fisherfaces model on the AT&T Facedatabase. I wrote a simple method `read_images`, which reads the images from a given path (and optionally resizes them). Make sure you have the folder structured as described above. The `read_images` method returns [X,y] being:

* **X**: A list of NumPy arrays (images).
* **y**: A list of integers (corresponding labels).

The source code listing is also in this github repository at:

* [facerec/py/apps/scripts/simple_example.py](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/apps/scripts/simple_example.py)

#### Results

Since the AT&T Facedatabase is a fairly easy database we have got a `95.5%` recognition rate with the Fisherfaces method (with a 10-fold cross validation):

```

And we can have a look at the Fisherfaces found by the model:

![fisherfaces_at](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/raw/master/py/apps/scripts/fisherfaces_at.png "fisherfaces_at")

### Advanced Examples: Building your own PredictableModel

Basically all face recognition algorithms are the combination of a [feature extraction](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/feature.py)
and a [classifier](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py). The Eigenfaces method for example is a Principal Component Analysis with a Nearest Neighbor classifier. Local Binary Patterns Histograms . The feature (which must be an [AbstractFeature](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/feature.py)) and the classifier (which must be an [AbstractClassifier](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py)) form a [PredictableModel](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/model.py), which does the feature extraction and learns the classifier.

So if you want to use the Fisherfaces method for feature extraction you would do:

```
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.model import PredictableModel

model = PredictableModel(Fisherfaces(), NearestNeighbor())
```

Once you have created your model you can call `compute(data,labels)` to learn it on given image `data` and their labels. There's nothing like a Dataset structure I enforce: You pass the images as a list of NumPy arrays (or something that could be converted into NumPy arrays), the labels are again a NumPy arrays of integer numbers (corresponding to a person).

```python

def read_images(path, sz=None):
    """Reads the images in a given folder, resizes images on the fly if size is given.

    Args:
        path: Path to a folder with subfolders representing the subjects (persons).
        sz: A tuple with the size Resizes 

    Returns:
        A list [X,y]

            X: The images, which is a Python list of numpy arrays.
            y: The corresponding labels (the unique number of the subject, person) in a Python list.
    """
    c = 0
    X,y = [], []
    for dirname, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path):
        for subdirname in dirnames:
            subject_path = os.path.join(dirname, subdirname)
            for filename in os.listdir(subject_path):
                try:
                    im = Image.open(os.path.join(subject_path, filename))
                    im = im.convert("L")
                    # resize to given size (if given)
                    if (sz is not None):
                        im = im.resize(self.sz, Image.ANTIALIAS)
                    X.append(np.asarray(im, dtype=np.uint8))
                    y.append(c)
                except IOError, (errno, strerror):
                    print "I/O error({0}): {1}".format(errno, strerror)
                except:
                    print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
                    raise
            c = c+1
    return [X,y]

# Read in the image data:
[X,y] = read_images("/path/to/your/image/data")
# Then compute the model:
model.compute(X,y)
# ...
```

#### Image processing chains

Sometimes it's also necessary to perform preprocessing on your images. This framework is quite advanced and makes it easy to experiment with algorithms. You can achieve image processing chains by using the [ChainOperator](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/operators.py). The ChainOperator computes a `feature1` and passes its output to a `feature2`. See the implementation of the `ChainOperator`, which is a `FeatureOperator`. The `FeatureOperator` in turn is an `AbstractFeature` again, so it can be the input for another `AbstractFeature`. Get it?

```python

class FeatureOperator(AbstractFeature):
	"""
	A FeatureOperator operates on two feature models.
	
	Args:
		model1 [AbstractFeature]
		model2 [AbstractFeature]
	"""
	def __init__(self,model1,model2):
		if (not isinstance(model1,AbstractFeature)) or (not isinstance(model2,AbstractFeature)):
			raise Exception("A FeatureOperator only works on classes implementing an AbstractFeature!")
		self.model1 = model1
		self.model2 = model2
	
	def __repr__(self):
		return "FeatureOperator(" + repr(self.model1) + "," + repr(self.model2) + ")"
		
class ChainOperator(FeatureOperator):
	"""
	The ChainOperator chains two feature extraction modules:
		model2.compute(model1.compute(X,y),y)
	Where X can be generic input data.
	
	Args:
		model1 [AbstractFeature]
		model2 [AbstractFeature]
	"""
	def __init__(self,model1,model2):
		FeatureOperator.__init__(self,model1,model2)
		
	def compute(self,X,y):
		X = self.model1.compute(X,y)
		return self.model2.compute(X,y)
		
	def extract(self,X):
		X = self.model1.extract(X)
		return self.model2.extract(X)
	
	def __repr__(self):
		return "ChainOperator(" + repr(self.model1) + "," + repr(self.model2) + ")"
```

So imagine we want to perform a TanTriggs preprocessing, before applying the Fisherfaces. What you would do is using the output of the `TanTriggsPreprocessing` feature extraction as input for the `Fisherfaces` feature extraction. We can express this with a `ChainOperator` in facerec:

```
from facerec.preprocessing import TanTriggsPreprocessing
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from facerec.operators import ChainOperator
from facerec.model import PredictableModel


feature = ChainOperator(TanTriggsPreprocessing(), Fisherfaces())
classifier = NearestNeighbor()
model = PredictableModel(feature, classifier)
```

#### Classifier

Start with a [Nearest Neighbor model](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/classifier.py) as a classifier. In its simplest form you would just need to write:

```
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor

classifier = NearestNeighbor()
```

This creates a 1-Nearest Neighbor with the Euclidean Distance as distance metric. To create a 5-Nearest Neighbor with a Cosine Distance instead, you would write:

```
from facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.distance import CosineDistance

classifier = NearestNeighbor(dist_metric=CosineDistance(), k=5)
```

If you want to build a `PredictableModel` to generate predictions, simply use the [PredictableModel](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/blob/master/py/facerec/model.py):

```
from facerec.model import PredictableModel
from facerec.feature import Fisherfaces
from.facerec.classifier import NearestNeighbor
from facerec.distance import EuclideanDistance

feature = Fisherfaces()

classifier = NearestNeighbor(dist_metric=CosineDistance(), k=5)
predictor = PredictableModel(feature, classifier)
```

Once you have created your model you can call `compute` to learn it. Please see the [examples](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/tree/master/py/apps/).

### sample application ###

I've hacked up the [videofacerec](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/tree/master/py/apps/videofacerec) application, which shows how easy it is to interface with the OpenCV2 API: [py/apps/videofacerec](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec/tree/master/py/apps/videofacerec).
