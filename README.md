Face Recognition Research
=========

All files I found during my research for a face recognition in Ruby on Rails.
Final project included:
+ Flash frontend to take a picture, crop and compress (jpg) it and upload it to the backend.
+ The Ruby on Rails Backend
+ OpenCV through the Python wrapper. I talked to python with ruby's backticks to execute system commands.

Result: A recognition ratio of 85% in a controlled environment (yeah!) and
less than 50% in the wild as the users shot pictures with their webcam in dark places or the sun as the backlight :)
